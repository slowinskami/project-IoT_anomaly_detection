** DATA PRE-PROCESSING ** 

dimensionality reduction methods used:

	- no-variance 
	- (low) correlation with other features
	- (high) correlation with the class


discretisation (manually) in Weka
	- 


normalisation

	- depends on the learning algorithm whether it needs it or not

	- depends on the feature selection method - for example in order to have good results for "low-variance" feature selection method, normalisation should be used first
