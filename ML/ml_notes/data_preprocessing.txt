** DATA PRE-PROCESSING ** 

dimensionality reduction methods used:

	- no-variance 
	- (low) correlation with other features
	- (high) correlation with the class


discretisation (manually) in script

	- based on the results from the autoencoder and my one-by-one walkthrough through the parameters
	- didn't specify all the flags to be binarised
	- could as well do it in Weka instead - much more straightforward and data- rather than expert_knowledge- based 


normalisation

	- depends on the learning algorithm whether it needs it or not

	- depends on the feature selection method - for example in order to have good results for "low-variance" feature selection method, normalisation should be used first
