** ML CLASSIFIERS **


Naive Bayes
	- very quick to create the model and test
	- assumes conditional independence of the features
	- sometimes work well even if features are


Bayesian Network
	- probabilistic model, takes codnitional dependence between features into account


J48 Decision Tree
	- decision tree, features' importance ranked based on the information gain measure

Random Forest
	- 


Multi Layer Perceptron


SVM
